/**
 * The IValueObject interface defines the contract for value objects in the domain. A value object is an immutable type that represents a concept or measurement in the domain, and its equality is based on its properties rather than its identity. The IValueObject interface includes methods for retrieving the underlying value, comparing value objects for equality, and providing a string representation of the value object.
