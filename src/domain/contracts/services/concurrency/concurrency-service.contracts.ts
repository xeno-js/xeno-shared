/**
 * @description The IConcurrencyService interface provides a contract for executing multiple asynchronous tasks in parallel while strictly controlling the maximum number of concurrent executions. This is crucial for protecting system resources (CPU, RAM) and avoiding event loop blocking during massive batch operations (e.g., processing large CSV files, bulk database inserts).
