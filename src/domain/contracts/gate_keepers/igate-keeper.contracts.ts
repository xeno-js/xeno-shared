/**
 * @description IGateKeeper defines the contract for gatekeeper services responsible for authorizing users based on their identity and permissions. It provides a method to check if a user has a specific permission, taking into account their roles and permissions. The authorize method checks if the user's permissions include the required permission or if they have a role that grants them access (e.g., SUPER_ADMIN or ADMIN). If the user does not have the necessary permissions, it returns false.
