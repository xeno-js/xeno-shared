/**
 * An interface representing a caching mechanism within the application. This interface provides methods for retrieving and storing values in the cache, as well as clearing the cache when necessary. The get method allows for retrieving values from the cache based on a specified key, while the set method enables storing values in the cache with an optional time-to-live (TTL) parameter to specify how long the value should remain in the cache before it expires. The clear method provides a way to remove all entries from the cache when needed.

  set<T>(key: string, value: T, ttl: Optional<number>): Promise<void>

  /**
   * Stores a value in the cache only if the specified key does not already exist. This method is useful for ensuring that a value is only set in the cache if it has not been previously stored, preventing overwriting of existing values. The TTL parameter specifies how long the value should remain in the cache before it expires, similar to the set method. If the key already exists in the cache, this method will return false, indicating that the value was not set; otherwise, it will store the value and return true.
   * @param key The unique identifier for the cached value. This key is used to store and retrieve values from the cache.
   * @param value The value to be stored in the cache associated with the specified key.
   * @param ttl Optional time-to-live (TTL) in milliseconds, indicating how long the value should remain in the cache before it expires. If not provided, the value will be stored indefinitely.
   * @returns True if the value was successfully stored in the cache because the key did not already exist; otherwise, returns false if the key already exists in the cache and the value was not set.
