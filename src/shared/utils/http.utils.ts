/**
 * @description This module provides utility functions for handling HTTP-related tasks, such as normalizing HTTP headers. It includes a single function, `normalizeHeaders`, which takes an input of unknown type and returns an object with normalized header values. The function ensures that all header values are converted to strings, and if a header value is an array, it joins the elements into a single string separated by commas. This utility is useful for ensuring consistent header formats when working with various HTTP client libraries.
