/**
 * @description The AuthPolicy interface defines the structure of an authorization policy, which includes a list of roles and permissions. This interface is used to represent the access control policies associated with different intents or actions within the application. Implementations of this interface can be used to enforce role-based and permission-based access control by specifying which roles and permissions are required for specific operations.
