/**
 * @description Concrete implementation of the IRemoteDataSource contract that utilizes an agnostic HTTP client and a resilience service to fetch data from remote endpoints. The RemoteDataSource class is responsible for sending HTTP requests based on the provided HttpClientRequest parameters, while leveraging the resilience features of the IServiceResilience to ensure reliable communication with external services. This implementation abstracts away the details of how HTTP requests are made and how resilience is handled, allowing for flexibility in choosing different HTTP clients and resilience strategies without affecting the consumers of the IRemoteDataSource interface.

  /** @description Private method that sends an HTTP request to a specified endpoint using the provided HttpRequest options. The method utilizes the resilience service to execute the request, ensuring that it is performed with built-in support for retries, timeouts, and circuit breakers. The response from the HTTP client is then wrapped in a ResultType, which encapsulates either the successful response data or an error, providing a consistent way to handle both success and failure cases.
   * @param endpoint The URL or endpoint to which the HTTP request is sent.
   * @param options The HttpRequest options that specify the HTTP method, headers, query parameters, body, and other request configurations.
   * @returns A Promise that resolves to a ResultType containing either the successful response data or an error if the request fails.
